# Personalized Content Curator

This project is made for the hackathon.

This project is designed as a handy tool for users to stay informed about the latest developments in specific topics of interest. It's not intended to substitute for in-depth news articles or comprehensive research. Instead, it's perfect for anyone who feels overwhelmed by the rapid pace of updates and wants a concise way to stay in the know.
